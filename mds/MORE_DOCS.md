`NO_SIGNIFICANT_IMPROVEMENT_POSSIBLE`

## Significance Mandate Assessment

* **Modifications Made:** 0
* **Modification Threshold:** 3 (30% of 13)
* **Assessment:** `NOT_MET`

## Justification for Decision

After a thorough review of the provided documentation set against the specific failure modes and the user's context, the current selection is deemed to be **optimal and exhaustive**. It achieves a state of "necessary and sufficient" documentation.

The list is exceptionally well-curated to address each root cause with a precise and authoritative source:

1. **The `exit 127` error** is a direct violation of the `command` specification, which is definitively covered by `docker/compose-spec/05-services.md`.
2. **The silent replica failure** is a nuanced issue involving both server-side authentication (`pg_hba.conf`) and client-side non-interactive password handling (`.pgpass`). The selection of both `PostgreSQL.../Chapter_21...pdf` and `PostgreSQL.../Chapter_34...pdf` completely and correctly covers both facets of this problem.
3. **The architectural flaws** (fragile WAL sharing, lack of robust startup orchestration) are addressed by a combination of practical guides (`Mastering Docker`, `Docker Deep Dive`) and the formal specifications for volumes and services.
4. **The user's limited knowledge** is directly addressed by including accessible guides for Debian, Python scripting, and Docker security fundamentals.

Any potential additions would introduce redundancy or reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby failing the significance mandate. For instance, while other PostgreSQL chapters are relevant to the technology, they are not as directly applicable to solving the *specific failures* as the chosen chapters on Authentication, Backup, and WAL. The current selection is a masterclass in targeted documentation for focused problem-solving. No modification could provide a >70% improvement without being redundant or overly broad.

## Final Recommended Documentation Set
