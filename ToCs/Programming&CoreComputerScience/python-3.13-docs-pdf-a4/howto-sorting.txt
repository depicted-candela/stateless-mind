Python lists have a built-in list.sort() method that modifies the list in-place. There is also a sorted() built-in
function that builds a new sorted list from an iterable.
In this document, we explore the various techniques for sorting data using Python.


1 Sorting Basics
A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the sorted() function. It returns a new sorted list:

>>> sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You can also use the list.sort() method. It modifies the list in-place (and returns None to avoid confusion).
Usually it’s less convenient than sorted() - but if you don’t need the original list, it’s slightly more efficient.
