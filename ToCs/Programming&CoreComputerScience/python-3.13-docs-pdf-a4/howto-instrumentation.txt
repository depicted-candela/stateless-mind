DTrace and SystemTap are monitoring tools, each providing a way to inspect what the processes on a computer
system are doing. They both use domain-specific languages allowing a user to write scripts which:
   • filter which processes are to be observed
   • gather data from the processes of interest
   • generate reports on the data
As of Python 3.6, CPython can be built with embedded “markers”, also known as “probes”, that can be observed by
a DTrace or SystemTap script, making it easier to monitor what the CPython processes on a system are doing.
CPython implementation detail: DTrace markers are implementation details of the CPython interpreter. No
guarantees are made about probe compatibility between versions of CPython. DTrace scripts can stop working or
work incorrectly without warning when changing CPython versions.
