 Abstract

 Sockets are used nearly everywhere, but are one of the most severely misunderstood technologies around. This is a
 10,000 foot overview of sockets. It’s not really a tutorial - you’ll still have work to do in getting things operational.
 It doesn’t cover the fine points (and there are a lot of them), but I hope it will give you enough background to
 begin using them decently.



1 Sockets
I’m only going to talk about INET (i.e. IPv4) sockets, but they account for at least 99% of the sockets in use. And I’ll
only talk about STREAM (i.e. TCP) sockets - unless you really know what you’re doing (in which case this HOWTO
isn’t for you!), you’ll get better behavior and performance from a STREAM socket than anything else. I will try to
clear up the mystery of what a socket is, as well as some hints on how to work with blocking and non-blocking sockets.
But I’ll start by talking about blocking sockets. You’ll need to know how they work before dealing with non-blocking
sockets.
Part of the trouble with understanding these things is that “socket” can mean a number of subtly different things,
depending on context. So first, let’s make a distinction between a “client” socket - an endpoint of a conversation, and
