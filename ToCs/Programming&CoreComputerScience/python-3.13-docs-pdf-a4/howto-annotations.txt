    Abstract

    This document is designed to encapsulate the best practices for working with annotations dicts. If you write
    Python code that examines __annotations__ on Python objects, we encourage you to follow the guidelines
    described below.
    The document is organized into four sections: best practices for accessing the annotations of an object in Python
    versions 3.10 and newer, best practices for accessing the annotations of an object in Python versions 3.9 and older,
    other best practices for __annotations__ that apply to any Python version, and quirks of __annotations__.
    Note that this document is specifically about working with __annotations__, not uses for annotations. If
    you’re looking for information on how to use “type hints” in your code, please see the typing module.



1 Accessing The Annotations Dict Of An Object In Python 3.10 And
  Newer
Python 3.10 adds a new function to the standard library: inspect.get_annotations(). In Python versions 3.10
and newer, calling this function is the best practice for accessing the annotations dict of any object that supports
annotations. This function can also “un-stringize” stringized annotations for you.
