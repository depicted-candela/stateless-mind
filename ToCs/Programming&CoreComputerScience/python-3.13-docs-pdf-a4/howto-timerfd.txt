This HOWTO discusses Pythonâ€™s support for the linux timer file descriptor.


1 Examples
The following example shows how to use a timer file descriptor to execute a function twice a second:

# Practical scripts should use really use a non-blocking timer,
# we use a blocking timer here for simplicity.
import os, time

# Create the timer file descriptor
fd = os.timerfd_create(time.CLOCK_REALTIME)

# Start the timer in 1 second, with an interval of half a second
os.timerfd_settime(fd, initial=1, interval=0.5)

try:
    # Process timer events four times.
    for _ in range(4):
        # read() will block until the timer expires
        _ = os.read(fd, 8)
        print("Timer expired")
finally:
    # Remember to close the timer file descriptor!
    os.close(fd)

To avoid the precision loss caused by the float type, timer file descriptors allow specifying initial expiration and
interval in integer nanoseconds with _ns variants of the functions.
This example shows how epoll() can be used with timer file descriptors to wait until the file descriptor is ready for
reading:
