 Abstract

 This document describes how to use the curses extension module to control text-mode displays.



1 What is curses?
The curses library supplies a terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard-handling facility for text-based ter-
minals; such terminals include VT100s, the Linux console, and the simulated terminal provided by various programs.
Display terminals support various control codes to perform common operations such as moving the cursor, scrolling
the screen, and erasing areas. Different terminals use widely differing codes, and often have their own minor quirks.
In a world of graphical displays, one might ask “why bother”? It’s true that character-cell display terminals are an
obsolete technology, but there are niches in which being able to do fancy things with them are still valuable. One
niche is on small-footprint or embedded Unixes that don’t run an X server. Another is tools such as OS installers and
kernel configurators that may have to run before any graphical support is available.
