Of course. Here is a summary of all the necessary features and concepts from the provided documents that you will need to solve the first exercise in `exercises.md`.

### Summary for Exercise 1: Hardware and Software Failure Types

This summary is structured into two parts: the high-level concepts required to answer the theoretical questions, and the specific Python features needed to implement the `processData.py` script.

---

### Part 1: Conceptual Foundations (from *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*)

These concepts are essential for understanding the "why" behind the exercise and for answering the theoretical questions.

#### 1. Reliability, Faults, and Failures

*   **Reliability**: The system should continue to work correctly even when things go wrong (adversity).
*   **Fault**: A component of the system deviates from its specification.
    *   **In this exercise**: The sensor producing a negative number is a **fault**.
*   **Failure**: The system as a whole stops providing its required service to the user.
*   **Fault Tolerance (Resilience)**: The ability of a system to anticipate faults and cope with them to prevent them from causing a system-wide failure. Your script is designed to be fault-tolerant regarding corrupted data.

#### 2. Types of Faults

The exercise simulates two distinct types of faults discussed in the text:

*   **Hardware Faults**: These are typically random and uncorrelated. The text gives examples like hard disk crashes or faulty RAM.
    *   **In this exercise**: The **negative numbers** simulate transient hardware faults, like data corruption during transmission. The correct response is often to retry or, as in this case, to acknowledge the fault and move on.
*   **Software Errors (Bugs)**: These are systematic errors within the code that are harder to anticipate and tend to be triggered by unusual inputs or circumstances.
    *   **In this exercise**: The input value of **`0`** is a trigger for a simulated software bug (`ZeroDivisionError`). These are often considered more severe because they represent a flaw in the system's logic.

### Part 2: Practical Python Implementation (from Python Tutorial & Library Reference)

These are the specific modules, functions, and syntax you need to write the `processData.py` script.

#### 1. File Handling: Reading `input.dat`

*   **Concept**: Use the built-in `open()` function with a `with` statement. This is the standard, robust way to handle files as it ensures the file is automatically closed even if errors occur.
*   **Structured Usage**:
    ```python
    try:
        with open("input.dat", 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                # Process each line here
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Handle the case where the file doesn't exist
    ```
*   **Key Properties**:
    *   `'r'` specifies read mode.
    *   Iterating directly over the file object `f` reads the file line by line, which is memory-efficient.
    *   Each `line` will be a string that includes a trailing newline character (`\n`), which you should remove using `.strip()`.

#### 2. The `logging` Module

*   **Concept**: Provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from your script. It allows you to configure message levels, formats, and output destinations.
*   **Structured Usage**:
    1.  **Configuration**: Set up the basic logging configuration at the start of your script.
        ```python
        import logging
        import sys

        logging.basicConfig(
            level=logging.INFO, # Sets the minimum level of messages to be shown
            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', # Defines the log format
            stream=sys.stdout  # Sends logs to the console
        )
        ```
    2.  **Emitting Messages**: Use the module-level functions to log messages at different severity levels.
        ```python
        logging.info("This is a standard operational message.")
        logging.warning("Something unexpected happened, but the program can continue.")
        logging.critical("A very serious error occurred. The program must terminate.")
        ```
*   **Key Properties**:
    *   `level`: Determines the minimum severity of messages to process. In the exercise, `INFO` is requested, which includes `INFO`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`, and `ERROR`.
    *   `format`: A string that specifies the layout of the log records.

#### 3. Error and Exception Handling

*   **Concept**: Use a `try...except` block to handle potential errors during program execution without crashing.
*   **Structured Usage**: The script needs to handle several potential exceptions.
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that might fail, e.g., converting a string to an integer
        value = int(line.strip())
        
        if value == 0:
            # A specific case we define as a fatal bug
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Simulated critical processing error")
            
    except ValueError:
        # This block runs if int() fails because the line is not a number
        logging.warning(f"Could not parse line: '{line.strip()}'.")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        # This block runs if our specific bug is triggered
        logging.critical("Fatal software bug triggered.")
        sys.exit(f"Terminated due to: {e}") # Exit the program
    ```

#### 4. Program Control Flow

*   **Conditional Logic (`if` statements)**: Used to check the value of the number read from the file and decide which action to take.
*   **The `continue` Statement**: Required for handling the transient hardware fault (negative numbers). It immediately stops the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next one.
*   **Terminating the Script (`sys.exit()`)**: This is the standard way to stop program execution gracefully. It works by raising the `SystemExit` exception. You should import the `sys` module to use it.
