## Summary for Exercise 3: Hardware and Software Failure Types

The goal of Exercise 3 is to demonstrate robust error handling in C, specifically focusing on graceful resource cleanup (removing a lock file) when a fatal software error like a segmentation fault occurs. This involves understanding C's low-level system interfaces, the nature of memory errors, and the general principles of building reliable systems.

### 1. C Programming Language (K&R)

This book is crucial for implementing the C programs (`naive_worker.c` and `robust_worker.c`) and understanding the language constructs.

*   **Chapter 1: A Tutorial Introduction**
    *   **Concept: Basic C Program Structure & Output**
        *   **Description:** Introduces the `main()` function as the program's entry point, basic variable declarations (`int`), and the `printf()` function for console output.
        *   **Structured Usage & Example:**
            ```c
            #include <stdio.h> // Necessary header for printf
            main() {
                printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Prints a string to standard output
                return 0; // Indicates successful execution
            }
            ```
*   **Chapter 5: Pointers and Arrays**
    *   **Concept: Pointers and Addresses (Section 5.1)**
        *   **Description:** A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. The `&` operator gives the address of an object, and the `*` operator performs indirection (dereferencing) to access the value at the address a pointer holds.
        *   **Structured Usage & Example (Relevant to Segmentation Fault):**
            ```c
            int x = 1;
            int *ip; // Declares ip as a pointer to an integer
            ip = &x;  // ip now holds the memory address of x
            *ip = 10; // The value at the address stored in ip (i.e., x) becomes 10
            ```
            *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** The instruction `*(int*)NULL = 0;` is a deliberate attempt to dereference a null pointer (`NULL` being a special address that programs are not allowed to access) and write a value to it. Understanding pointers is fundamental to knowing *why* this causes an illegal memory access.
*   **Chapter 7: Input and Output**
    *   **Concept: File Access (Section 7.5)**
        *   **Description:** Standard library functions to open, close, and manipulate files.
        *   **Specifications & Usage:**
            *   `FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode)`: Opens a file. Returns a `FILE` pointer or `NULL` on failure. `filename` is the path; `mode` specifies access (e.g., `"w"` for write, `"r"` for read).
            *   `int fclose(FILE *stream)`: Closes an open file stream. Returns `0` on success, `EOF` on error.
            *   `int remove(const char *filename)`: Deletes a file from the filesystem. Returns `0` on success, non-zero on failure.
            *   `void perror(const char *s)`: Prints an error message to `stderr` based on the global `errno` variable.
        *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** Both `naive_worker.c` and `robust_worker.c` need to *create* and potentially *remove* a lock file (`.lock`). `fopen()` creates the file, `remove()` deletes it. `perror()` can be used for debugging file operations.
    *   **Concept: Error Handling - Stderr and Exit (Section 7.6)**
        *   **Description:** `stderr` is a standard output stream for error messages. The `exit()` function terminates the program.
        *   **Specifications & Usage:**
            *   `int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)`: Prints formatted output to a specified stream. `stderr` is passed as the `stream` argument for error messages.
            *   `void exit(int status)`: Terminates the calling process immediately. `status` is an integer value returned to the parent process; `0` conventionally indicates success, non-zero indicates an error. `exit()` performs cleanup like flushing file buffers.
        *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** The robust solution needs to log critical errors to `stderr` using `fprintf(stderr, ...)`, and then terminate gracefully with `exit(non-zero_status)`.
*   **Appendix B: Standard Library**
    *   **Concept: Signals: `<signal.h>` (Section B.9)**
        *   **Description:** Provides facilities for handling exceptional conditions (signals) that arise during execution, such as illegal memory access (`SIGSEGV`).
        *   **Specifications & Usage:**
            *   `void (*signal(int sig, void (*handler)(int)))(int)`: This is the core function for signal handling.
                *   `sig`: The signal number to handle (e.g., `SIGSEGV` for segmentation violation, `SIGINT` for Ctrl+C, `SIGTERM` for termination request).
                *   `handler`: A function pointer to the signal handler function. This function must accept one integer argument (the signal number). Special values are `SIG_DFL` (default handler) and `SIG_IGN` (ignore signal).
                *   **Return Value:** `signal()` returns the previous handler for the specified signal, or `SIG_ERR` on error.
            *   **Signal Handler Properties:** A crucial characteristic is that signal handlers execute in a restricted context. They should be as simple as possible. Avoid non-async-signal-safe functions (like `printf`, `malloc`, `fopen`, `fclose`) inside handlers, as they can lead to undefined behavior or deadlocks if the main program was in the middle of such an operation when the signal arrived. `write()` to `STDOUT_FILENO` or `STDERR_FILENO` and `_exit()` (or `exit()` if carefully used and understood that it might not be fully async-signal-safe, but is often used for simplicity in examples) are generally considered safer.
            *   `int raise(int sig)`: Sends the specified signal `sig` to the calling process. Used here to re-raise `SIGSEGV` after cleanup, allowing the OS to perform its default actions (like generating a core dump).
        *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** This is the core mechanism for Part B. The `robust_worker.c` program must `signal(SIGSEGV, handleSegfault)` to intercept the segmentation fault, allowing `handleSegfault` to clean up the lock file before the program fully terminates. The handler then `raise(sig)` to allow default termination.

### 2. Computer Organization and Design (Patterson & Hennessy)

This book provides the low-level architectural and operating system context for understanding *why* segmentation faults occur.

*   **Chapter 4: The Processor**
    *   **Concept: Exceptions (Section 4.10)**
        *   **Description:** Exceptions (also called interrupts) are unscheduled events that disrupt the normal flow of instruction execution. They are critical for handling unexpected events like memory access violations. When an exception occurs, the processor typically:
            1.  Saves the address of the offending instruction (in a special register like **EPC** - Exception Program Counter).
            2.  Records the cause of the exception (in a **Cause register**).
            3.  Transfers control to a prearranged address in the operating system's kernel (an exception handler).
        *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** A segmentation fault is a type of exception. This section explains the general hardware/OS flow when such an error happens, providing the context for how C's `SIGSEGV` mechanism ties into the underlying system.
*   **Chapter 5: Large and Fast: Exploiting Memory Hierarchy**
    *   **Concept: Virtual Memory (Section 5.7)**
        *   **Description:** Virtual memory is a technique that gives programs the illusion of a large, contiguous address space, even if physical memory is fragmented or smaller. It involves mapping **virtual addresses** (used by programs) to **physical addresses** (actual hardware memory locations) via **page tables** maintained by the operating system.
        *   **Key Property: Memory Protection:** Virtual memory's primary motivation is to allow efficient and safe sharing of memory among multiple programs, protecting them from interfering with each other's data. Each program has its own address space, and the OS ensures a program can only access its assigned memory.
        *   **Concept: Page Faults (within 5.7)**
            *   **Description:** If a program tries to access a virtual memory address that is not currently mapped to a valid physical memory page (e.g., it's on disk, or it's an invalid address altogether), a "page fault" occurs. This is an exception that transfers control to the operating system. The OS then decides how to handle it (e.g., load the page from disk, or terminate the program if the access is illegal).
            *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** When `*(int*)NULL = 0;` is executed, the program attempts to write to a memory address that the operating system has explicitly marked as invalid or non-writable. The hardware's Memory Management Unit (MMU) detects this illegal access, triggers a page fault (a type of exception), and the operating system responds by sending a `SIGSEGV` signal to the process, leading to its termination. This explains the ultimate "cause" of the fatal error.

### 3. Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppmann)

This book provides the high-level system design principles and context for understanding why robust error handling is important.

*   **Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications**
    *   **Concept: Reliability: Hardware Faults, Software Errors, Human Errors (Section "Reliability")**
        *   **Description:** Defines reliability as a system continuing to work correctly despite adversity. Critically differentiates between a **fault** (a component deviating from its specification, e.g., a software bug) and a **failure** (the system as a whole failing to meet its service guarantees, e.g., the program crashing and leaving stale resources).
        *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** The segmentation fault (`*(int*)NULL = 0;`) is a **software bug** (a fault). If the program crashes and leaves the lock file behind, that causes a **system failure** (the service cannot restart). The robust solution *prevents* the fault (the segmentation fault) from becoming a full-blown system failure by ensuring cleanup. DDIA advocates designing systems to tolerate faults to prevent failures.
    *   **Concept: Importance of Fault Tolerance (within "Reliability")**
        *   **Description:** DDIA emphasizes designing **fault-tolerant** or **resilient** systems that can cope with faults. It discusses that it's often better to design for faults to prevent them from becoming failures.
        *   **Relation to Exercise 3:** The `robust_worker.c` program embodies this principle by explicitly handling a fatal fault (`SIGSEGV`) to perform essential cleanup, thus making the system more resilient and allowing for automated restarts without manual intervention.
