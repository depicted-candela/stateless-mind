# `README.md` (Enhanced and Corrected)

This directory contains the exercises for **1.1.1 Reliability and Fault Tolerance: Recovery mechanisms**. All exercises run within a self-contained Docker Compose environment designed for robustness and compatibility with rootless Docker on Debian 12.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker and the Docker Compose plugin installed and running.
2.  **make**: The `make` utility must be installed (`sudo apt-get install build-essential`).

## Environment Lifecycle Management

A `Makefile` is provided to simplify managing the UCEE. It will automatically generate a `.env` file on its first run with your user's permissions and default ports to ensure a conflict-free setup.

**1. Activate (Build and Start)**

This command prepares and launches the entire environment.

```bash
make up
```

**2. Stop and Start**

You can stop the running services without losing their state, and start them again later. This is useful for pausing your work.

*   To stop all running containers:
```bash
make stop
```
*   To start the previously stopped containers:
```bash
make start
```

**3. Deactivate (Teardown and Cleanup)**

This command stops all services and completely removes all containers, networks, and **volumes** associated with the project. This ensures your system is returned to a clean state.

```bash
make down
```

**4. View Logs**

To view the real-time logs from all running services, use:

```bash
make logs
```

## Executing Exercise Solutions

The exercises in `exercises/recovery-mechanisms.md` will require you to run Python scripts or interact with the databases directly.

**1. Running Python Solution Scripts**

The solution scripts are located in the `solutions/` directory and can be run from within the `pythonClient` service. The `Makefile` provides a shortcut for the replication lag check.

*   **Example (using Makefile target):**
```bash
make test-lag
```
*   **General Purpose (for other scripts):**
```bash
docker-compose exec python_client python /solutions/pitrOrchestrator.py
docker-compose exec python_client python /solutions/fullRecoveryOrchestrator.py
```

**2. Accessing the Databases**

You can connect to the primary and replica databases directly using `psql` via the `Makefile` targets.

*   **Connect to Primary Database:**
```bash
make psql-primary
```
*   **Connect to Replica Database:**
```bash
make psql-replica
```

## Architecture and Configuration Explained

This environment is designed to be robust, especially for rootless Docker setups. Here are the key design choices:

*   **Internal WAL Archiving**: The `primary` database archives its WAL files to a subdirectory *within its own data volume* (`/var/lib/postgresql/data/wal-archive`). This avoids the "Permission denied" errors that occur when a rootless container tries to write to a host-mounted volume it doesn't own.
*   **Read-Only Volume Sharing**: The `replica` service gains access to the WAL files by mounting the `primary`'s data volume in read-only mode. This is a secure and efficient way to share the necessary recovery data.
*   **Automated Permissions**: On first startup, an initialization script (`00-init-permissions.sh`) runs inside the `primary` container. It automatically configures the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow replication connections and creates the WAL archive subdirectory with the correct internal permissions. This eliminates the need for manual configuration or permission hacks.

# Configuration Files

<details>
<summary><code>.env</code> (Auto-generated by `make`)</summary>

```dotenv
 This file is auto-generated by the Makefile on the first run.
 It captures your user ID and group ID for seamless volume permissions
 and sets default host ports to avoid conflicts.
UID=1000
GID=1000
PRIMARY_HOST_PORT=5433
REPLICA_HOST_PORT=5434
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>Makefile</code></summary>

```makefile
 Makefile for managing the Stateless Mind PostgreSQL Environment

 This target automatically creates a .env file with the current user's UID/GID
 if one does not already exist. This is crucial for rootless Docker volume permissions.
.PHONY: all
all: .env

.env:
	@echo "Creating default .env file..."
	 Use $$ to escape the $ for `make`, so the shell executes the command substitution.
	@echo "UID=$$(id -u)" > .env
	@echo "GID=$$(id -g)" >> .env
	@echo "PRIMARY_HOST_PORT=5433" >> .env
	@echo "REPLICA_HOST_PORT=5434" >> .env

 Load environment variables from .env file to make them available to this Makefile
 and subsequent shell commands.
include .env
export PGPASSWORD=password

```bash

 This script runs once as root when the database is first initialized.

 1. Create a subdirectory within the archive volume for WAL files.
mkdir -p /var/lib/postgresql/data/wal-archive

 2. Change ownership of this NEW subdirectory to the postgres user.
 This is allowed because the root user (inside the container) created the directory.
chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/data/wal-archive

 3. Append a rule to pg_hba.conf to allow the replica to connect for replication.
echo "host replication all 0.0.0.0/0 md5" >> "$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf"

echo "Initialization complete: pg_hba.conf updated and WAL archive directory prepared."
