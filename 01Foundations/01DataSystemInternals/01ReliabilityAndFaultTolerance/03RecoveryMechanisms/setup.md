This directory contains the exercises for **1.1.1 Reliability and Fault Tolerance: Recovery mechanisms**. All exercises run within a self-contained Docker Compose environment designed for robustness and compatibility with rootless Docker on Debian 12.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker and the Docker Compose plugin installed and running.
2. **make**: The `make` utility must be installed (`sudo apt-get install build-essential`).

#### Environment Lifecycle Management

A `Makefile` is provided to simplify managing the User-Centric Execution Environment (UCEE). It will automatically generate a `.env` file on its first run with your user's permissions and default ports to ensure a conflict-free setup.

**1. Activate (Build and Start)**

This command prepares and launches the entire environment.

```bash
make up
```

**2. Stop and Start**

You can stop the running services without losing their state, and start them again later. This is useful for pausing your work.

*   To stop all running containers:
    ```bash
    make stop
    ```
*   To start the previously stopped containers:
    ```bash
    make start
    ```

**3. Deactivate (Teardown and Cleanup)**

This command stops all services and completely removes all containers, networks, and **volumes** associated with the project. This ensures your system is returned to a clean state.

```bash
make clean
```

**4. View Logs**

To view the real-time logs from all running services, use:

```bash
make logs
```

### Executing Exercise Solutions

The exercises in `exercises/recovery-mechanisms.md` will require you to run Python scripts or interact with the databases directly.

**1. Running Python Solution Scripts**

The solution scripts are located in the `solutions/` directory and can be run from within the `python_client` service. The `Makefile` provides a shortcut for the replication lag check.

- **Example (using Makefile target):**
  
    ```bash
    make test-lag
    ```
  
- **General Purpose (for other scripts):**
  
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec python_client python /solutions/pitrOrchestrator.py
    docker-compose exec python_client python /solutions/fullRecoveryOrchestrator.py
    ```
  

**2. Accessing the Databases**

You can connect to the primary and replica databases directly using `psql` via the `Makefile` targets.

- **Connect to Primary Database:**
  
    ```bash
    make psql-primary
    ```
  
- **Connect to Replica Database:**
  
    ```bash
    make psql-replica
    ```
  

### Architecture and Configuration Explained

This environment is designed to be robust, especially for rootless Docker setups. Here are the key design choices:

- **Internal WAL Archiving**: The `primary` database archives its WAL files to a subdirectory *within its own data volume* (`/var/lib/postgresql/data/wal-archive`). This avoids the "Permission denied" errors that occur when a rootless container tries to write to a host-mounted volume it doesn't own.
- **Read-Only Volume Sharing**: The `replica` service gains access to the WAL files by mounting the `primary`'s data volume in read-only mode (`:ro`). This is a secure and efficient way to share the necessary recovery data.
- **Automated and Idempotent Setup**: The entrypoint scripts for both `primary` and `replica` are designed to be robust. The replica's script waits in a loop for the primary to be fully ready for replication, solving the startup race condition. It also uses replication slots to ensure the primary doesn't delete WAL files before the replica has consumed them.
