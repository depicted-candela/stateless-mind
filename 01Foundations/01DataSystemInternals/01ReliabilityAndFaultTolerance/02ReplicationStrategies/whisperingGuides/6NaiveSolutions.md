**Flaws in the Naive "Dual-Write" Approach:**

*   **No Consistency Guarantee:** The document emphasizes that a write succeeding on one server but failing on another leads to inconsistent databases. There's no single source of truth.
*   **No Failover Logic for Writes:** The application logic would need to handle cases where a server fails and comes back online, having missed writes, which is complex and error-prone.
*   **Read Inconsistency (Stale Reads):** Even if writes are successful on both servers, a read might land on a lagging server, resulting in stale data. This is without any formal mechanism to manage or measure the lag.
*   **Operational Complexity:** The application becomes responsible for data consistency, a task better handled by the database itself, making the application fragile.

**Correct Implementation (Leader-Follower Replication):**

The solution involves leveraging the Docker environment set up in Exercise 1. The key steps are:

1.  **Establish Leader-Follower Replication:** This refers to the setup process detailed in "Exercise 1: Setting Up and Verifying Leader-Follower Replication" of the `exercises.md` file. This involves configuring Docker Compose, leader and follower `postgresql.conf` files, creating a replication user, replication slot, and performing a base backup.
2.  **Simplified Application Logic:**
    *   **Writes:** All write operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) are directed *always* to the leader's address (which is `localhost:5433` in the provided `docker-compose.yml`).
    *   **Reads:** All read operations (`SELECT`) can be load-balanced between the leader (`localhost:5433`) and the follower (`localhost:5434`). The follower is read-only.

The Python script `naiveSolutions.py` (provided in `ai_context.csv`) demonstrates this correct approach by:

*   Defining connection parameters for both leader and follower.
*   Implementing `updateProductQuantity` function to write to the leader.
*   Implementing `getProductQuantity` function to read from a randomly chosen endpoint (leader or follower).
*   Including a `time.sleep(1)` call to allow for replication to occur before subsequent reads.

**Relevant Concepts and Configurations:**

*   **Docker and Docker Compose:** Essential for setting up the isolated and consistent environment for the leader-follower PostgreSQL setup. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the `leader` and `follower` services, ports, volumes, and network.
*   **PostgreSQL Configuration:**
    *   `postgresql.conf` for both leader and follower: critical for setting `listen_addresses`, `wal_level`, `max_wal_senders`, `wal_keep_size`, and `hot_standby`.
    *   `pg_hba.conf` on the leader: needs an entry for the replication user (`host replication replicator all md5`).
*   **Replication User and Slot:** Necessary for establishing the streaming replication link.
*   **`pg_basebackup`:** Used to take a base backup from the leader to initialize the follower. The `-R` flag is important for automatically writing `standby.signal` and connection info.
*   **Streaming Replication:** The core mechanism used for replicating WAL records from the leader to the follower.
*   **`psycopg2`:** The Python library used to connect to PostgreSQL databases.
*   **`psycopg2.connect()`:** Used to establish connections to the leader and follower.
*   **`conn.cursor()`:** Used to create cursor objects for executing SQL commands.
*   **`cur.execute()`:** Used to run SQL commands like `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT`.
*   **`conn.set_session(readonly=True)`:** Essential for ensuring reads from the follower are read-only.
*   **`random.choice()`:** Used to simulate load balancing reads across available endpoints (leader and follower).
*   **`time.sleep()`:** Used to introduce a delay, allowing time for replication to occur between writes and reads.
